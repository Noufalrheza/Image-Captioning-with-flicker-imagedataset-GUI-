## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Noufalrheza/Image-Captioning-with-flicker-imagedataset-GUI-
    cd image-creation-project
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook ImageCreation.ipynb
    ```

2. Run the cells sequentially to execute the code. The notebook is divided into sections:
   - **Import Modules**: Import necessary Python libraries.
   - **Setup Directories**: Define the base and working directories.
   - **Model Training and Image Generation**: Code for training the model and generating images.
